# /preflight — RCX Session Preflight Check

Run this at the START of every session. It reads canonical sources and reports current state.

## Steps

1. Read `STATUS.md` — extract current phase, debt counts (THRESHOLD, CURRENT, FLOOR), and testing tier status.

2. Read `TASKS.md` (first 200 lines) — identify active NEXT items, any promoted/demoted tasks since last session.

3. Run `./tools/checks/check_docs_consistency.sh` — validate STATUS.md matches reality. Report any failures.

4. Run `./tools/checks/check_agent_review_needed.sh` — check for uncommitted core changes needing agent review.

5. Run `python3 mu/tools/checks/check_host_semantics_ratchet.py` — verify host debt ratchet is clean.

6. Run `python3 tools/checks/check_host_authority_inventory_ratchet.py` — verify authority inventory ratchet.

7. Run `node mu/host/js/eval_step.js 2>&1 | tail -3` — verify JS substrate is healthy.

8. Check `git status` — report any uncommitted changes, untracked files in runtime dirs.

9. Check `git log --oneline -5` — show recent commits for context.

## Output Format

Produce a concise summary:
```
PREFLIGHT COMPLETE
Phase: <phase>
Debt: <CURRENT>/<THRESHOLD> (tracked markers)
Authority: <current>/<baseline> (inventory)
Active NEXT: <list items>
Ratchets: <pass/fail>
JS Parity: <pass/fail>
Uncommitted: <count files> / Agent review needed: <yes/no>
Recent: <last 3 commits one-line>
```
