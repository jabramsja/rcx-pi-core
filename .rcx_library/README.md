# RCX Library (local canon shelves)

This directory holds the RCX canon shelves used by "RCX Librarian Mode".

- `.rcx_library/CANON/`      = theory canon (definitions, codex, formalism, seeds)
- `.rcx_library/CANON_EXEC/` = execution canon (python/rust/asm/c runtime machinery)

If these are empty, it means the canon is not present in this repo checkout.
