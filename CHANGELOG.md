# Changelog


## Unreleased

- Schema-triplet canonicalization: added `rcx_pi/cli_schema_run.py` as the single source of truth and updated CLI smoke + tests to route schema checks through the canonical runner (PRs #59–#62).
All notable changes to RCX-Ω are documented in this file.

- Category: Docs / Schemas / Runtime / Tests / Tooling
- Notes: Must distinguish "frozen contract" vs "future target"

## 2026-01-12

### Tooling
- Kernel step-003/004: stabilize world_trace_cli invocation (script + module); tests now 216 passed, 1 skipped.
- Verified repo green gate (212 passed, 1 skipped).
- Freeze tag created on dev: `rcx-freeze-verified-2026-01-12` → `18c2dad`.
- Quarantine cleanup / ignore rules for accidental CLI-arg files.
- Added world trace CLI (Python).
- Added core MU freezer utility (`rcx_pi_rust/scripts/freeze_core_mu.py`).

## 2026-01-03

### Docs
- Frozen external CLI + JSON contracts in `docs/RCX_OMEGA_CONTRACTS.md`.
  - Notes: This freeze reflects CURRENT runtime behavior. Any future targets (e.g., `kind=omega_summary`) are explicitly marked as future and are NOT required today.

### Schemas
- Published optional JSON Schemas under `schemas/rcx-omega/`:
  - `trace.v1.schema.json`
  - `omega_summary.v1.schema.json`
- Policy: `kind` and `schema_version` are OPTIONAL and MUST remain opt-in + environment-gated. Default runtime output remains byte-for-byte identical.

### Process
- Added staging → stable promotion checklist in `docs/STAGING_TO_STABLE.md`.

### Runtime
- No runtime changes in this entry.

## 2026-01-03

### Runtime
- Added env-gated OPTIONAL schema fields to JSON producers:
  - Set `RCX_OMEGA_ADD_SCHEMA_FIELDS=1` to inject `schema_version` (and `kind` if absent).
  - Default output remains unchanged when the env var is not set.

### Docs
- Updated `docs/RCX_OMEGA_CONTRACTS.md` with a “Runtime Reality Notes” section to reflect current behavior:
  - `kind` may be omitted or may use legacy values (e.g., `omega`).
  - `kind=omega_summary` remains a FUTURE target, not a frozen requirement.
  - `schema_version` is OPTIONAL and opt-in only.

### Tests
- Verified green gate: `python3 -m pytest -q`

## 2026-01-23

### Tests
- Enforced **orbit artifact idempotence** for tracked files.
  - Re-running `scripts/build_orbit_artifacts.sh` no longer dirties the working tree.
- Formalized **orbit provenance semantics**:
  - Provenance entries validated against emitted state transitions.
  - Supports both legacy (`from` / `to`) and current (`pattern` / `template`) schemas.
  - State entries may be strings or structured objects (e.g. `{"i": 0, "mu": "ping"}`).

### Tooling
- Added Graphviz SVG normalization to strip version-specific metadata.
  - SVG fixtures are now stable across Graphviz versions.
- Added `scripts/merge_pr_clean.sh` helper for repositories with auto-merge disabled.
  - Rebase head onto base, safe force-push, gate wait, manual merge, post-merge sync.
  - Convenience script only; repository policy unchanged.

### Process
- Confirmed layered-growth rule enforcement:
  - Kernel remains frozen.
  - All new behavior implemented via tools, fixtures, or validation layers.
- Green gate verified after each change sequence.

Notes:
- No kernel or runtime semantics were modified.
- All changes live strictly outside the frozen RCX-π core.
