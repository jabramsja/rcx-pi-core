# RCX-π Core v1

A minimal, **purely structural** RCX-π core:

- No names inside the engine
- No strings in the core substrate
- Everything is built from `μ(...)` motifs and structural patterns
- Arithmetic, combinators, closures, projections, activation, and meta-classification all emerge from shape alone

This repo is a **toy-but-real** RCX-π kernel you can actually run and inspect.
