RCX CORE SPEC v1
================

Purpose:
    RCX describes how information behaves when the distinction between 0 and 1 
    is allowed to recursively explore itself. The engine must remain lossless, 
    self-referential, and capable of reclassification over time.

The model is not static — it evolves. Nothing is thrown away.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUCKETS (FINAL 3-BUCKET REALITY MODEL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every motif (μ) is classified into one of three resolution states:

    1. Ra
        - Stable resolution
        - Integrated truth
        - Terminal for current world state
        - Equivalent to "escape" or successful projection

    2. Lobe
        - Unresolved frontier
        - Not contradictory, not integrated
        - Holds potential to collapse to Ra or Sink later
        - Stores structural information for reprocessing

    3. Sink
        - Contradiction / paradox / unresolved negative
        - Not deleted — retained as semantic residue
        - Source of shadow sets and future reinterpretation

Note:
    Lobes and Sink together form the "potential space". 
    Ra is the only resolved space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OMEGA (ω) BEHAVIOR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ω is NOT a bucket. It is a *meta-state* detected during iteration.

Definition:
    ω-cycle occurs when a motif never reaches Ra, Lobe, or Sink terminally,
    but instead transitions endlessly or returns to previously seen states.

Representation:
    μ.state = LOBE
    μ.omega = cycle signature
    μ.last_transition_count = N
    μ.revisit = true

Meaning:
    ω represents "unresolved but active". 
    It is potential, not failure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOBE MANAGEMENT RULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent infinite unresolved growth:

    - Lobes can be *compressed* to signature objects if inactive
    - Compression is lossless and reversible
    - Rehydration occurs when new rules or worlds may resolve them

Compression record form:

    LobeSignatureObject:
        hash
        minimal core form
        last_state
        provenance
        rehydrate_on_change = true

No lobe is deleted. Ever.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECURSION AND RESIDUE FLOW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computation Model:

    Step 1: motif enters evaluation
    Step 2: if resolvable → Ra
    Step 3: if contradictory → Sink (stored)
    Step 4: if undecided → Lobe (stored)
    Step 5: Lobes + Sink are fed back through evaluation loops
    Step 6: ω-cycles flagged, not bucketed

Residue Loop:
    Sink → hemispheres → fold → new projection → (Ra | Lobe | Sink | ω)

This repeats until ω-limit (convergent or stable oscillation).
No informational branch dies; it transitions states.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORLD EVOLUTION FRAMEWORK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

World = rule-set for classification & behavior.

Three modes exist:

    1. Manual Mode:
        user edits or defines rules

    2. Score-Selected Evolution Mode:
        candidate worlds are evaluated and ranked against a spec
        winners propagate; others archived

    3. Genetic / Automatic Mode:
        mutation + recombination generates new worlds automatically

Metadata stored per world:

    accuracy vs spec
    mismatch count
    ω-frequency
    lobe density
    sink entropy
    evolution lineage

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOSSLESSNESS REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. No motif is deleted.
2. Sink is not terminal — only currently negative.
3. Lobes must be reversible.
4. ω must be traceable.
5. Every historical route is stored for future reclassification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPING TO RCX-π (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ra  --> "Ra" bucket in worlds JSON
Lobe --> "Lobe" bucket
Sink --> "Sink" bucket
ω    --> detected cyclic route, stored in route metadata

Future integration: 
    compressed lobe signatures, evolutionary rehydration,
    score-driven spec refinement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOING FORWARD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This spec forms the foundation.
Next expansions may include:

    - Residue compression format
    - Lobe-to-Ra rehydration heuristics
    - Multi-world conversation protocol
    - Proof format for stabilization or divergence
    - Visualization interface
    - Integration into Rust core
