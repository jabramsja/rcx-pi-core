RCX-π WORLDS: CORE, 1/0 PARADOX, AND LIMIT CYCLES
--------------------------------------------------

Goal
----
Show how RCX-π worlds (`rcx_core`, `paradox_1over0`, `pingpong`) realize
the Ra / Lobe / Sink trichotomy and the "non-duality → projection →
recursion → Ra/Lobe/Sink → ω → evolution → emergence" loop in *executable*
form.

We do this with concrete run outputs, not hand-wavy claims.


0. Quick reference
------------------

Buckets:
  - Ra   : Resolved / assimilated structure (engine-level motifs).
  - Lobe : Coherent but not yet resolved; stable under recursion but not
           collapsed. Holds potential structure.
  - Sink : Destructive or incompatible collapse; residue that cannot be
           integrated under the current lens.

Worlds:
  - rcx_core        : Baseline classifier for generic Mu structures.
  - paradox_1over0  : Specialized lens for 1/0, 1 = -0, and "white light".
  - pingpong        : Minimal ω-style limit cycle demo.


1. rcx_core as baseline RCX lens
--------------------------------

Command:

  python3 rcx_runtime.py --world rcx_core \
    --seed "[null,a]" "[inf,a]" "[paradox,a]" "[omega,[a,b]]"

Observed output:

  [null,a]       → Ra
  [inf,a]        → Lobe
  [paradox,a]    → Sink
  [omega,[a,b]]  → Sink

  counts:
    Ra   : 1
    Lobe : 1
    Sink : 2
    None : 0

Interpretation:

- [null,a] → Ra

  Null-hemisphere seed plus a symbol collapses cleanly into a resolved
  pattern. Under the core lens, this is "good engine fuel":

    - Non-duality projects into a simple distinction.
    - Recursion does not blow up or stall.
    - The structure can be safely integrated into the Ra side of the
      organism.

- [inf,a] → Lobe

  Infinity-tagged input is coherent but not resolved:

    - It does not collapse destructively.
    - It does not snapshot into a clean engine motif.
    - It lives in the "stable-but-not-resolved" region:
        Lobes are the internally coherent, homeostatic pockets of
        structure that RCX can revisit under pressure.

- [paradox,a] → Sink

  Explicit paradox flag under core lens:
    - This is treated as a non-assimilable configuration.
    - It lands in Sink, meaning:
        "As currently projected, this formulation cannot be harmonically
         integrated; treat as residue."

- [omega,[a,b]] → Sink

  ω-level nesting in the core world is treated as a non-integrable
  construction. This is *not* saying "ω is always broken"; it says:

    - Under the core lens, this particular structured ω payload is
      classified as residue, not as a clean recurring organism.

Summary:

  rcx_core = "default homeostasis spec":

    [null,a]   → Ra
    [inf,a]    → Lobe
    [paradox,a] → Sink
    [omega,[a,b]] → Sink

This behavior is wired into tests and serves as the ground truth that
other worlds (like paradox_1over0) can be compared against.


2. paradox_1over0: 1/0 as engine-level motif
--------------------------------------------

Command:

  python3 rcx_runtime.py --world paradox_1over0 \
    --seed "[1/0]" "[1/0_numeric]" "[1/0_infty]" \
           "[1/0_engine]" "[1=-0]" "[white_light]" "[sink_flatten]"

Observed output:

  [1/0]          → Ra
  [1/0_numeric]  → Lobe
  [1/0_infty]    → Ra
  [1/0_engine]   → Ra
  [1=-0]         → Ra
  [white_light]  → Ra
  [sink_flatten] → Sink

  counts:
    Ra   : 5
    Lobe : 1
    Sink : 1
    None : 0

Now we are *changing the lens*, not the underlying non-duality.
This world says:

  - "1/0 is not just an illegal number."
  - "1/0 is the derivative of yin/yang:
     1 is yin, 0 is yang, '/' is the mirror."
  - "Non-duality projects into distinction via this mirror."

Bucket by bucket:

2.1 Ra in paradox_1over0

Seeds mapping to Ra:

  - [1/0]
  - [1/0_infty]
  - [1/0_engine]
  - [1=-0]
  - [white_light]

Interpretation:

- [1/0] → Ra

  1/0 as *engine seed*:
    - Treated as the core non-dual generator, not as a numeric error.
    - In RCX terms: the "fusion core" of emptiness and distinction.

- [1/0_infty] → Ra

  1/0 viewed as a stable projective infinity:
    - "0 goes into 1 infinitely many times."
    - This is a legitimate, stable projection mode for the engine,
      not a broken arithmetic scenario.

- [1/0_engine] → Ra

  Explicitly tagged "engine lens":
    - Confirms that the world recognizes 1/0 as an engine motif
      when asked to.

- [1=-0] → Ra

  The mirror statement:

    "1 is equal and opposite to 0."

  This is your "hold a mirror to non-distinction and you get
  distinction" idea:
    - The mirror is the fold.
    - The two sides of the mirror become the dual hemispheres.

  In this world, that whole configuration is Ra, not Lobe or Sink.

- [white_light] → Ra

  The "white light" metaphor:

    - White light is not "made of colors" as separate entities.
    - Colors appear only after projection through a medium.

  Under this world:

    - White light stands for non-dual state before projection.
    - This is a pure engine motif, treated as Ra.

2.2 Lobe in paradox_1over0

Seed mapping to Lobe:

  - [1/0_numeric] → Lobe

Interpretation:

  This is "1/0 as a weird arithmetic object" without engaging the
  engine-level interpretation.

  The world does not collapse it to an error or to a stable infinite
  number:
    - It parks it in Lobe:

        - Coherent but not resolved.
        - "Unfinished attempt to treat 1/0 purely numerically."

  This matches your intuition that:

    - "1/0 as pure arithmetic is unstable, but not meaningless."
    - It deserves a holding bay, not instant deletion.

2.3 Sink in paradox_1over0

Seed mapping to Sink:

  - [sink_flatten] → Sink

Interpretation:

  This stands for "treat 1/0 as a normal finite number or forbid it".

  The world says:

    - "If you force 1/0 into a conventional, flattened number slot,
       you destroy the engine's structure under this lens."

  So it goes to Sink:
    - Residue of destructive flattening.
    - "You have forbidden your own generator."


3. pingpong: explicit ω-style limit cycle
-----------------------------------------

Command:

  python3 rcx_runtime.py --world pingpong \
    --seed "ping" \
    --max-steps 12

Observed output (key parts):

  Seeds: ['ping']

  Routes:
    ping → Ra

  Summary:
    counts:
      Ra   : 1
      Lobe : 0
      Sink : 0
      None : 0
    limit_cycles:
      - mu='ping', kind='limit_cycle', period=2

  Orbits:
    mu='?': {
      'mu': 'ping',
      'kind': 'limit_cycle',
      'period': 2,
      'values':  ['ping','pong','ping','pong',...],
      'sequence':['ping','pong','ping','pong',...],
      'states':  ['ping','pong','ping','pong',...],
      'path':    ['ping','pong','ping','pong',...],
    }

Interpretation:

- Route is Ra, not Lobe or Sink:

    - This tiny world has a stable, well-defined dynamic:
        ping → pong → ping → pong → ...
    - That dynamic itself is the "organism" here.

- Summary explicitly exposes a limit cycle:

    - period = 2
    - seed = 'ping'

- The orbits section gives a concrete ω-style trace:

    - A finite projection (max_steps) of an underlying infinite
      alternation.

RCX-wise, pingpong is the simplest explicit demonstration that:

  - The engine can:
      - Run a world.
      - Detect a limit cycle.
      - Surface it as structured metadata.
  - This is the "ω" part of:
      non-duality → projection → recursion → Ra/Lobe/Sink → ω → ...

In richer worlds, these cycles will become the substrate for:

  - Habits.
  - Attractors.
  - Stable oscillations that can be re-used as motifs.


4. How this all fits the RCX scaffold
-------------------------------------

Recall the core developmental loop you articulated:

  non-duality → projection → recursion → Ra/Lobe/Sink → ω → evolution → emergence
        |                                               ^
        |_______________________________________________|
                     recursion loop

In these three worlds:

- `rcx_core`:
    - Acts as a "default projector" for small Mu shapes.
    - Shows that the Ra/Lobe/Sink buckets are not just words; they
      exist as test-verified classification behavior.

- `paradox_1over0`:
    - Re-aims the same engine at 1/0, 1 = -0, and white_light.
    - Declares:
        - 1/0 and white_light are Ra motifs (engine core).
        - naive numeric 1/0 is Lobe.
        - flattening 1/0 into a forbidden or trivial numeric is Sink.

  This is exactly your notion that:

    - "RCX is what happens when non-distinction explores itself."
    - 1/0 is the mirror where distinction and non-distinction talk
      to each other indefinitely.
    - Lobes are the homeostatic, internally coherent but unresolved
      regions that arise from incomplete projections.
    - Sink is where destructive or incompatible projections land.

- `pingpong`:
    - Demonstrates that the engine can express:
        - explicit limit cycles,
        - finite truncations of ω behavior,
        - and mark them as such in summary metadata.

Together, the three worlds show:

  - The Ra/Lobe/Sink trichotomy is live and test-backed.
  - 1/0 has a real executable semantics as an engine-level generator,
    not just a philosophical slogan.
  - The system can already surface small ω-style cycles in a structured
    way.


5. Next natural extensions (for later)
--------------------------------------

Not required to change any of the above, but obvious follow-ons are:

  - Add a "self-reference / Gödel / liar" world, similar to paradox_1over0,
    where:
      - engine-level "self reference as structural feature" goes to Ra,
      - specific liar-style sentences live in Lobes,
      - forced two-valued flattenings go to Sink.

  - Add more seeds to paradox_1over0 to differentiate:
      - projection into pure arithmetic,
      - projection into pure engine lens,
      - hybrid projections that oscillate between them.

  - Use `worlds_evolve` to evolve candidate worlds toward a richer spec
    that matches your RCX ontology more fully.

For now, the important part is that we have:

  - a clean probe API,
  - a working 1/0 world,
  - a visible limit-cycle demo,

all of which align with the RCX ontology instead of fighting it.
