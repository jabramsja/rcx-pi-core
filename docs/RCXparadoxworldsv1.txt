RCX PARADOX WORLDS v1
=====================

Purpose
-------

This document defines *paradox-focused worlds* for RCX, in a way that can be
implemented later in rcx_pi / rcx_pi_rust / worlds_json without breaking the
existing green test suite.

We design three conceptual worlds:

    W_1O   : world for 1/0 as non-dual recursion engine
    W_LIAR : world for the liar paradox
    W_RSTAR: world for Russell/Gödel-style self-reference

Each world is defined in terms of:

    - WORLD NAME
    - ROLE in RCX ontology
    - SEEDS (μ-strings we probe)
    - ROUTE TABLE (Ra / Lobe / Sink, ω-flags)
    - INTENDED BEHAVIOR (how it fits non-duality → projection → recursion → Ra/Lobe/Sink → ω → evolution → emergence)


0. SHARED PRIMITIVES
--------------------

Buckets:

    Ra   = Stable resolution within this world.
    Lobe = Stable-but-not-resolved frontier (internally coherent, not yet integrated).
    Sink = Contradiction / residue (stored, not deleted).

Meta-tag:

    ω    = Non-halting / cyclical behavior under this world’s rules.

Global RCX metaphysics:

    - Non-duality (1/0, 1 = –0) is the *engine*, not a single value.
    - Hemispheres:
         • Null hemisphere: favors "0 / emptiness / non-distinction"
         • Infinity hemisphere: favors "1 / fullness / distinction"
    - Fold: the Mobius hinge "1 is equal and opposite to 0"; where hemispheres exchange constraints.
    - Residue loop: Lobes + Sink feed forward into new projections and new worlds.

We assume the existing tri-bucket model from rcx_core:

    Ra   ↔ "Ra"
    Lobe ↔ "Lobe"
    Sink ↔ "Sink"

and the existing world-probing machinery (worlds_probe, score/evolve functions, etc.) as the eventual executable target.


1. WORLD W_1O : 1/0 AS ENGINE
------------------------------

WORLD NAME
    "paradox_1over0" (symbolic)
    Short: W_1O

ROLE
    - Make 1/0 *explicitly* a first-class engine glyph, not an error.
    - Demonstrate how 1/0 decomposes into:
         - ENGINE role (Ra, ω-flagged)
         - LOCAL NUMERIC anomalies (Lobe → Ra / Sink in other worlds)
         - RESIDUE (failed flattenings) in Sink.

SEEDS (conceptual μ-strings)
    μ₁ = "[1/0]"         ; raw non-dual engine glyph
    μ₂ = "[1/0_numeric]" ; 1/0 as naive arithmetic operation
    μ₃ = "[1/0_infty]"   ; 1/0 → ∞ in projective numeric world
    μ₄ = "[1/0_engine]"  ; explicit engine role: "non-dual recursion generator"
    μ₅ = "[1=-0]"        ; equal-and-opposite identity glyph
    μ₆ = "[white_light]" ; alias for "non-dual undifferentiated state"
    μ₇ = "[RGB_split]"   ; projection of white_light into [R,G,B] structure
    μ₈ = "[sink_flatten]" ; "force engine to be a normal finite ratio"
    μ₉ = "[omega_cycle_1o]" ; explicit ω-cycle instance for 1/0


ROUTE TABLE (intended classification in W_1O)

    μ₁ = [1/0]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Core engine glyph.
            - Stable as "non-dual recursion generator".
            - ω-flag indicates intrinsic non-halting nature.

    μ₂ = [1/0_numeric]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - "1/0 as naive arithmetic operation" is coherent as an object,
              but not integrated here; its proper place is a numeric sub-world.
            - Candidate to be projected into numeric worlds where it may become:
                Ra (e.g. 1/0 → ∞ in extended projective line),
                or Sink (strict reals).

    μ₃ = [1/0_infty]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - "formal ∞ from 1/0" is accepted as a stable local structure
              in the extended numeric lens of W_1O.
            - This is *not* the whole engine, just one projection.

    μ₄ = [1/0_engine]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Explicit naming of the engine role.
            - Should always be classified identical to μ₁ but more explicit.

    μ₅ = [1=-0]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Equal-and-opposite identity glyph for the fold.
            - Represents the Mobius hinge where 1 and 0 are two faces of the
              same non-dual manifold.
            - ω because its implications cascade without terminal halt.

    μ₆ = [white_light]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Non-dual, pre-split state.
            - Equivalent to "non-distinction" / undifferentiated engine.
            - Stable as an identity element in this world.

    μ₇ = [RGB_split]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Example of "projection into structured distinctions".
            - Stable shape, but not *the* engine; it depends on world context.
            - Lives in Lobe because it is a frontier structure: it can re-collapse
              back into white_light or be reinterpreted in other worlds.

    μ₈ = [sink_flatten]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Represents attempts to treat 1/0 as "just a finite rational number"
              or to forbid it entirely as meaningless.
            - These moves break the engine story and are stored as residue.

    μ₉ = [omega_cycle_1o]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Explicit representation of an ω-cycle induced by 1/0 in a specific
              sub-world (e.g. repeated renormalization attempts).
            - Lives in Lobe because it is a frontier behavior pattern:
                stable-as-cycle, not yet integrated into Ra.


INTENDED BEHAVIOR (W_1O)
------------------------

    - 1/0 as ENGINE (μ₁, μ₄, μ₅, μ₆) is Ra + ω-flagged.
    - Projections (μ₂, μ₃, μ₇, μ₉) show how 1/0 manifests in numeric / structural
      sub-worlds; these mostly become Lobe or Ra.
    - Residue (μ₈) is captured in Sink to avoid deleting mis-frames; they can fuel
      future world adjustments.
    - At ω-limit:
        Ra    ≈ engine glyphs + some stable projections (∞, white_light)
        Lobe  ≈ structured projections (RGB, numeric anomalies, explicit ω-cycles)
        Sink  ≈ destructive flattenings that deny the engine
        ω     ≈ intrinsic to engine motifs; they never fully halt internally.


2. WORLD W_LIAR : LIAR PARADOX
------------------------------

WORLD NAME
    "paradox_liar"
    Short: W_LIAR

ROLE
    - Make "This statement is false" a *first-class oscillation generator*.
    - Separate:
         - its oscillatory role (Ra, ω-flagged),
         - its naive 2-valued reading (Lobe),
         - brittle assumptions that force pure T/F (Sink).

SEEDS
    μ₁ = "[L]"          ; the liar statement "This statement is false."
    μ₂ = "[L_prop]"     ; L treated as pure proposition (T or F)
    μ₃ = "[L_osc]"      ; L treated as an oscillation generator
    μ₄ = "[L_T_only]"   ; attempt to force L permanently True
    μ₅ = "[L_F_only]"   ; attempt to force L permanently False
    μ₆ = "[L_3val]"     ; 3-valued interpretation: "paradox / both / neither"
    μ₇ = "[L_meta]"     ; meta-level description: "produces T/F oscillation"
    μ₈ = "[L_omega]"    ; explicit ω-cycle trace for T↔F toggling

ROUTE TABLE (intended classification in W_LIAR)

    μ₁ = [L]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - The raw liar sentence, un-typed, is an ω-oscillator in any
              strict 2-valued world.
            - In W_LIAR, we treat it as a frontier object that can be split into
              roles (prop vs oscillator).

    μ₂ = [L_prop]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - L as plain proposition under T/F semantics.
            - It never stabilizes, but the *pattern* of toggling is stable.
            - Kept in Lobe until world semantics are chosen.

    μ₃ = [L_osc]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Core insight: "L is a generator of T/F oscillation."
            - As a *role*, this is coherent and integrated in this world.
            - ω-flag indicates its intrinsic non-halting pattern.

    μ₄ = [L_T_only]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Attempt to assert L is permanently True under 2-valued logic.
            - Contradicts itself; stored as destructive assumption.

    μ₅ = [L_F_only]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Attempt to assert L is permanently False under 2-valued logic.
            - Also self-contradictory.

    μ₆ = [L_3val]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - 3-valued or paraconsistent interpretation: "paradox / both / neither."
            - In a suitable many-valued world, this is an integrated Ra outcome.

    μ₇ = [L_meta]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Meta-level description: "L induces T/F oscillation in 2-valued systems."
            - Stable meta-truth; ω-flag because it *refers* to a non-halting behavior.

    μ₈ = [L_omega]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Concrete cycle trace of T↔F toggling.
            - Frontier object that can be imported into other worlds as a pattern.

INTENDED BEHAVIOR (W_LIAR)
--------------------------

    - W_LIAR is a *clinic* for self-reference in truth-valuation.
    - It makes the oscillatory role of the liar (μ₃, μ₇, μ₈) explicit.
    - It keeps naive T-only / F-only stances in Sink.
    - It allows 3-valued / paraconsistent interpretations (μ₆) to live in Ra
      when the world’s semantics support them.
    - At ω-limit:
        Ra    ≈ "L as oscillation generator" + "L as paradox-value in richer logics"
        Lobe  ≈ raw liar under unspecified logics, explicit ω-traces
        Sink  ≈ brittle classical attempts to force T-only or F-only
        ω     ≈ the core toggling behavior itself.


3. WORLD W_RSTAR : RUSSELL / GÖDEL
-----------------------------------

WORLD NAME
    "paradox_rstar"
    Short: W_RSTAR

ROLE
    - Capture Russell’s set paradox and Gödel’s self-referential sentence as a
      single motif: "system tries to fully classify itself and breaks."
    - Distinguish:
         - meta-level insight (Ra),
         - internal naive object (Lobe),
         - brittle system assumptions (Sink),
         - ω-cycles at proof / membership boundaries (ω).

SEEDS
    μ₁ = "[R_set]"       ; Russell set R = { x | x ∉ x }
    μ₂ = "[R_mem]"       ; proposition "R ∈ R" (membership question)
    μ₃ = "[R_nomem]"     ; proposition "R ∉ R"
    μ₄ = "[G_sentence]"  ; Gödel sentence G: "G is not provable in S"
    μ₅ = "[G_provable]"  ; state "S proves G"
    μ₆ = "[G_unprovable]"; state "S does not prove G"
    μ₇ = "[R_meta]"      ; meta-level insight: need stratification / type levels
    μ₈ = "[G_meta]"      ; meta: "S is incomplete if consistent"
    μ₉ = "[R_sys_complete]" ; assumption: system must be complete + naive
    μ₁₀ = "[G_sys_all_true_provable]" ; assumption: all truths provable in S
    μ₁₁ = "[R_omega]"    ; oscillation of R ∈ R ↔ R ∉ R
    μ₁₂ = "[G_omega]"    ; oscillation of "provable / not provable" in too-small S

ROUTE TABLE (intended classification in W_RSTAR)

    μ₁ = [R_set]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Russell’s set as an internal object in naive set theory.
            - Drives an ω-cycle in membership classification.

    μ₂ = [R_mem]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - "R ∈ R" toggles with its negation under naive comprehension.

    μ₃ = [R_nomem]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - "R ∉ R" toggles with its opposite, same ω-cycle.

    μ₄ = [G_sentence]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Gödel sentence internal to S.
            - Its status (provable/unprovable) toggles interpretation.

    μ₅ = [G_provable]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - If S proves G, S proves a statement that says "I am not provable."
            - This breaks consistency; captured as destructive assumption.

    μ₆ = [G_unprovable]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - "S does not prove G" is a coherent condition, but its *status*
              lives on the frontier: it implies G is true-but-unprovable.

    μ₇ = [R_meta]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Meta insight: you need stratified / typed set theory or controlled
              comprehension to avoid Russell-type paradoxes.
            - Stable integrated truth in this world.

    μ₈ = [G_meta]
        route: Ra
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Meta insight: any sufficiently strong, consistent formal system S
              is incomplete (cannot prove all truths about itself).
            - Stable integrated truth.

    μ₉ = [R_sys_complete]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Assumption: "A naive set system can be complete and consistent and
              still allow R as a normal set."
            - This is what actually fails; stored as residue.

    μ₁₀ = [G_sys_all_true_provable]
        route: Sink
        flags: ω = false
        meaning:
            - Assumption: "All arithmetical truths are provable in S."
            - Gödel shows this cannot hold if S is consistent.

    μ₁₁ = [R_omega]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Explicit ω-cycle trace: R ∈ R ↔ R ∉ R under naive comprehension.
            - Frontier object illustrating what goes wrong.

    μ₁₂ = [G_omega]
        route: Lobe
        flags: ω = true
        meaning:
            - Explicit ω-cycle trace: attempts to classify G within S oscillate
              if you insist on completeness.

INTENDED BEHAVIOR (W_RSTAR)
---------------------------

    - W_RSTAR is a *clinic* for self-reference in sets/proofs.
    - It promotes meta-insights (μ₇, μ₈) to Ra.
    - It keeps the raw self-referential forms (μ₁–μ₄, μ₁₁, μ₁₂) in Lobe, ω-flagged.
    - It stores brittle completeness assumptions (μ₉, μ₁₀) in Sink.
    - At ω-limit:
        Ra    ≈ stable meta-structure about incompleteness / stratification
        Lobe  ≈ recurring self-reference motifs whenever systems overreach
        Sink  ≈ specific over-strong assumptions that break in each world
        ω     ≈ internal self-oscillation whenever a system tries to seal itself.


4. HOW TO IMPLEMENT LATER (NON-BREAKING)
----------------------------------------

When you eventually wire these into rcx_pi / Rust, a safe incremental path is:

    Step 1: Add conceptual worlds in JSON / μ WITHOUT touching existing ones.
        - e.g. worlds_json/paradox_1over0.json
              worlds_json/paradox_liar.json
              worlds_json/paradox_rstar.json

    Step 2: Use the existing CLI:
        - python3 -m rcx_pi.worlds_json to-mu paradox_1over0.json rcx_pi_rust/mu_programs/paradox_1over0.mu
        - same for liar, rstar.

    Step 3: Add new probe seeds to a dedicated test file:
        - rcx_pi/worlds/test_worlds_paradox.py
        - Use the same pattern as test_worlds_probe.py:
              from rcx_pi.worlds_probe import probe_world
              def test_paradox_1over0_basic():
                  fp = probe_world("paradox_1over0", [...seeds...])
                  assert ... route classifications match this doc ...

    Step 4: Run:
        - python3 -m pytest
      and ensure:
        - All old tests still pass.
        - New tests only exercise the new worlds.

We keep rcx_core and existing examples untouched, so nothing you have built
so far is invalidated. These paradox worlds just become new lobes in the codebase,
ready to be integrated further.
