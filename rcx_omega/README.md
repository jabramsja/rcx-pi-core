# RCX-Ω (staging)

This directory is the forward-growth lane beyond the frozen RCX-π kernel.

Rules:
- Do not modify the RCX-π kernel except for bugfixes that keep `scripts/green_gate.sh` green.
- New behavior goes here first (Ω layers), then optionally graduates via explicit contracts.

Immediate Ω goals (tracked):
- Self-hosting / motif-defined evaluator experiments (separate from rcx_pi core)
- Meta-projection layers
- Observer curvature modeling
- Emergent world generation tooling
